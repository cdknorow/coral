# Release Notes

## Next release — security and encryption hardening

### Removed

- Retired the runtime LLM proxy/MITM path, provider-key loading, Connected Apps/OAuth routes and registries, and legacy workflow token injection. Historical proxy, cost, OAuth, and connection rows remain preserved for compatibility; no credentials or user data are deleted automatically.

### Added

- Optional SQLCipher encryption for the sessions and message-board databases. Encryption is disabled by default and can be enabled with startup password or owner-protected key-file unlock modes.
- Explicit plaintext-to-encrypted migration with paired-database preparation, rollback markers, recovery guidance, and retained plaintext backups.
- SQLCipher/SQLite/OpenSSL notices, reviewed dependency policy, exact native-library identity attestations, encrypted package self-tests, and non-publishing Linux/Windows/macOS package verification workflows.

### Compatibility and boundaries

- Encryption covers only the sessions and message-board databases. Transcripts, logs, artifacts, uploads, screenshots, API keys, shell history, CA files, and other files remain outside this database-encryption scope.
- Encrypted key rotation and encrypted-to-plaintext disable/decrypt are unsupported until a dedicated offline operation exists. Lost password/key material requires a user-managed backup or data discard.
- Encrypted builds require CGO, the fts5 build tag, a compiler, OpenSSL development/runtime libraries, and the reviewed SQLCipher driver. Plaintext-compatible builds remain supported when the codec is unavailable.
- Release packaging now fails closed on unreviewed or mismatched native-library identity, versions, hashes, or macOS slices.

### Verification status

Local arm64 encryption, migration, dependency-policy, package self-tests, and failure controls pass. Universal macOS, Linux, and Windows extracted-package execution, native UI password-entry behavior on every platform, signing, and runner-resolved advisory/backport evidence still require external CI. This change does not claim a fully production-validated encrypted release.
